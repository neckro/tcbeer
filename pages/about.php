<p> Cheers!  We're Joe, Ben, and Ryan! </p>

<p> This page will be expanded soon.  For now, here are the bare facts: </p>

<p> We came up with the idea for TCB in winter 2004, while drinking some unsatisfactory American lagers (hint: Bud), we realized that a Minnesotan should never be without a decent brew in hand.  After a bit of thinkin'  and drinkin', we realized that we had the wherewithal to devise an appropriate online venue to share our love of fine beer. </p>

<p> Almost a year later, we feel it is finally time to unleash the fruits of our passion (no, we don't mean it in that way).  This is a site borne of beer.</p>
