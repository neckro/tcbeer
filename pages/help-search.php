	<h1>Search help</h1>
	<p>There are three kinds of searches:
	<ul>
	<li>searches for specific beers in your area (by ZIP code or city)
	<li>searches for bars in your area (by ZIP code)
	<li>general searches through the entire database
	</ul></p>

	<p>Here are some quick guidelines for each:</p>

	<p><ul>

	<li><strong>Beer searches:</strong><br>
	To search for a beer in your area, enter "<code>(beername) in (location)</code>".  Location can either be a 5-digit ZIP code or a city name.  The database will be searched for all beers that match your input in the location specified.  For example:
	<blockquote><code><a href="/search/guinness_in_minneapolis">guinness in minneapolis</a>
	<br><a href="/search/miller_in_55418">miller in 55418</a></code></blockquote>
	When searching by ZIP code, the "in" can be omitted:
	<blockquote><code><a href="/search/guinness_55414">guinness 55414</a></code></blockquote>

	<li><strong>Bar searches:</strong><br>
	To search for bars in your area, simply enter the ZIP code:
	<blockquote><code><a href="/search/55421">55421</a></code></blockquote>

	<li><strong>General searches:</strong><br>
	To find a bar, beer, brewery, or style in the database, simply enter the name:
	<blockquote><code><a href="/search/leinenkugel's">leinenkugel's</a></code></blockquote>
	<blockquote><code><a href="/search/lager">lager</a></code></blockquote>
	If exact matches cannot be found, approximate matches will be searched for.  If you still get no results, make sure your spelling is correct, or try browsing the individual sections instead.

	</ul></p>
